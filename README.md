Prototype Log

Errors Encountered:
 - After multiple tries we couldn't code the field of view for the guard; to create a field of view I needed to use a mesh filter and renderer but I couldn't use this method as it conflicted with the sprite renderer of the guard sprite. Will have to find a compatible method of rendering a field of view for the guard.
